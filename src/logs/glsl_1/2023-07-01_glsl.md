Something like 5 years ago, [I dabbled a little with glsl on the gl-transitions project](https://gl-transitions.com/gallery) of 
[@greweb](https://genart.social/@greweb). It was really fun (the "I don't really know what I'm doing" kind of fun :-D), and I learned a lot. Since, I didn't had the time to do some low-level webGL stuff.

This week-end, I wanted to do some low-level 2D shaders again (I'm not very good at this, but it's fun :-D ).

It was also a pretext to: 
- port to typescript the WebGL utility methods from Gregg Tavares: https://webglfundamentals.org/webgl/resources/webgl-utils.js. 
- wrapping it in a Svelte component, with editable GLSL code, to be able to easily use it in my Svelte projects.

[Next things on the topic, I'll probably try WebGL2/GLSL #version 300 es](/logs/2013-07-04_glsl).

## Examples

_(please note: the examples below are in webGL/GLSL 1.0, not 2.0)_

It's always fun to poke around in shaders code, and see what happens when you change a value, a function here and there and see the result. **Be sure to try editing the code !**

**A simple example, with a gradient, and lot of sin/cos functions:**  
(move your mouse over the drawing!).

<EditableShader fragShader={shaderFrag}/> 

**A more complex example, with a Voronoi [(from Inigo Quilez)](https://iquilezles.org/www/articles/voronoilines/voronoilines.htm)**

<EditableShader fragShader={voronoiFrag}/>
