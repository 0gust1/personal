## AI

Once again, [Simon Willison](https://twitter.com/simonw) (co-creator of the pyhton Django framework, and founder of Datasette) is someone worth following on this topic/field.

**Google and OpenAI have no MOAT in LLMs**

A supposedly-leaked google internal memo that claims that nor Google nor OpenAI have a significant MOAT (business's ability to maintain competitive advantages over its competitors in order to protect its long-term profits and market share) in the domain of LLMs (large language models).

https://www.semianalysis.com/p/google-we-have-no-moat-and-neither

This is explained by the open-source vitality of the domain, and the releases of Alpaca models (by meta), and actors like HuggingFace (who strongly pushes the open-source side of AI/ML).

**Wikipedia worries about AI-generated articles and LLMs usage**

## Colors

Two colors that will never cease to fascinate me:

- [Cosmic latte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_latte), the average color of the universe.
- [Eigengrau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigengrau), the color you see when you close your eyes.

Two websites / apps that do a decent job to create color scales and palettes:

- https://colorbox.io/
- https://palettte.app
