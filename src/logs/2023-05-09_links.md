### Setting `<html>` attributes with Sveltekit:

https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/3091
It's not that easy depending on the use case.

### Firefox-based alernative browsers

I recently tried ArcBrowser (which has a lot of hype and promises), but it seems that I'm not receptive to its features and UX/UI. It's also based on chromium/webkit, which is a bit sad.

The chromium/webkit monoculture is a problem, and is bad for the web (remember IE6/IE monoculture ?).

Here some gecko/firefox-based alternatives. (Caution, no guarantee of quality or privacy):

### Polymath - Convert any music library into a music production sample-library with ML

Didn't try it yet, but it seems fun and interesting.

https://github.com/samim23/polymath

One could integrate this with [my youtube-dl scripts](/posts/2019-11-17_octatrack-samples-youtube) to generate an Octatrack-ready sample library of any youtube video.

## Music

### Aydio - Deltitnu

A timeless classic.

<Youtube id="bIGkICeZa-Q" altThumb={true}/>

### A.L.I.S.O.N & Hotel Pools - "Pulse"

It pleases a lot my inner 80s child.

<Youtube id="FIKDrPQT3sQ"/>

### KOLINGA - Kongo feat. Gaël Faye

Soul-talking music (congo has a particular place in my heart and in my family).
