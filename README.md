# 0gust1 - website - sveltekit

I stole some code and ideas from those 2 projects:

- https://github.com/mattjennings/sveltekit-blog-template
- https://github.com/mvasigh/sveltekit-mdsvex-blog

I changed some things to make it more to my liking, and added some features.

You're free to use and adapt this code as you see fit.

## Features

- Static website, no server runtime needed.
- Content is written in markdown, with special powers thanks to [mdsvex](https://mdsvex.com/).
- RSS feeds are great, RSS is not dead.

## Run

Clone the repository, then:

### Locally, dev mode

```bash
npm ci && npm run dev
```

### Locally, prod mode

```bash
npm ci && npm run build && npm run preview
```
